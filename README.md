# Self Driving Cars Part 1 ðŸš—

## Description

This is the first part of my self-driving cars project, where I build a virtual environment for small self-driving vehicles to navigate. The purpose of this project is to explore the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence, such as working with neural networks and applying them to a dynamic environment.

## Features

This project follows a classic method for building interactions, using buttons.

This approach demonstrates how such systems were designed about 30 years ago.


With the buttons, you can:

- Add new nodes (points) and edges (segments).

- Remove nodes and edges.


Remarks

The second part of this project takes a more modern approach. Instead of buttons, it relies on mouse controls, which are designed to feel intuitive without requiring any on-screen instructions.

Using the left and right mouse buttons, you can:

- add new points with or without segments

- select and deselect points

- delete points

Of course, once I finish the second part I will upload it to GitHub as well.


## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.
3. Try clicking the buttons and see how it works!
